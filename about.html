          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>An Enthusiast who loves to work with a large amount of data proficient in SQL, Python, Data warehousing, Power BI, Tableau, R, Excel.  </p>
          <p>I take extreme delight in turning large dull datasets into numbers that tell stories and present them using tools that can be exploited to drive and enhance processes, strategies, and decisions.</p>
          <p>In my prior work experience, I worked on cleaning and processing a large amount of clinical data which helped me devise and customize reports and dashboards for various departments of the sales team.</p>               
          <p> My ability to convert Ideas and Information into Visual Innovations helped me work on a large amount of Hospital records to Identify inactive HCPs likely to contact the Medical Reps, providing insights to sales to increase the renewals by 10%.</p>
          <p>I love to clean, organize, analyze, summarize, and visualize data using SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau.</p>
          <p> I enjoy working cross-functionally, as a part of a team and have experience as a primary point of contact at the client's site.</p>
          <p> I am always passionate about learning new things and achieving goals and performing equally efficiently at approaching deadlines and downtimes. </p>
        
          <!-- <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused
            communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application
            according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly
            with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p> -->
