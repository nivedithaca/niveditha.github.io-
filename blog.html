          <h1>My first blog.(05/09/2022)</h1>
          <p>
              Hello everyone! 
          </p>
          <p>
            Hope everyone is doing great and if not, then don't worry, we shall make to the other end. 
            The blogs on this forum will be an attempt on my end to share updates about my life and few other things with the hope that it may help someone. 
            For few, this particular blog and a few future ones may not seem to be of any use, 
            because this particular blog does not really have an intriguing topic to discuss and also because I am very new to blog writing, 
            and with that being said my efforts would be to provide cogent and helpful information over the time, with the hope that I get better at blogging. LOL.
