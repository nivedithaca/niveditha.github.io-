              Hello everyone! 
          </p>
          <p>
            Hope everyone is doing great and if not, then don't worry, we shall make to the other end. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Started my journey in the world of data in the year 2017 as an Associate analyst at Accenture, India.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just to give a little back ground about myself. I have been an obese kid almost my entire childhood and teenage years, until that one day came where heartbrake led me to the gym
            and before even I knew, things started to change. I am sure, there are many people out there who can relate to this story, so why should you read ahead?
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, to answer that question, let me give everyone an overview of what this forum is all about:
        </p>

        <p>1) I have taken the journey of fat to fit, but what everyone seems to not talk much about is how to stay fit. </p>
            So if you are someone, who became fit or were fit but for some reason lost all your progress, these blog posts are going to be for you. 
            Becase guess what, I have gone through the cycle of "fat to fit" and "fit to fat" several times, and as of this moment, I am obese again, but not for long.
            Stay tuned to progress with me as I walk through this transformation.
            <p>2) I am an American Council On Exercise Certified personal trainer and Corrective Exercise Specialist, so all the information on this forum is going to be from a scientific ascpect.</p>
           <p> 3) Apart from being a software developer, 
            I also had the honour to serve the health and fitness industry for a few years, hence all the things that we are going to talk about over here are also going to stem from my personal experiences.
