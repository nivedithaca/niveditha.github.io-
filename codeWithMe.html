            Check out this repository to get a deep insight into advance data querying using SQL over a large dataset.
          </p>
          <p>
              This repository refers to the publicly available IMDB dataset. There are few questions that we can ask to perform analytics over the dataset. 
              Below here are the questions for which the SQL queries has been written.
          </p>
          <p>Q1. Back in 2016, several actors publicly declared they were going to abandon the profession if Trump was elected President.

            <p>Q4.- An organization of Sci-fi fans wishes to create a list with the top-15 most horrible directors: directors of Sci-fi movies sorted by worst average rating such that the directors have directed at least five Sci-fi movies in total, and there are at least 1,000 votes for each movie.</p>
            
            <p>Q5.- To make it more credible, a casting director working on the sequel of Slumdog Millionaire wants to retrieve alive actors whose last name is Patel or Raj who have acted in at least five Drama movies and have not acted in any Comedy movie.</p>

            <p>Q9.- Steve-o is the largest organization interested in people named ‘Steve.’ They wish to give a $10,000 check to each alive Steve-o person known for at least four Drama or Thriller movies. All these movies must have a single director only. They wish to give an extra check of $5,000 to those top based on the average rating of the movies they are known for.</p>

            <p>
                Diseases can influence individuals both genuinely and intellectually, as contracting and living with an
                illness can adjust the influenced individual's viewpoint on life. A sickness that influences the parts of a living being,
                which isn't in view of any quick outer injury. Diseases are regularly known to be ailments that are identified with explicit
                indications and signs. The deadliest sicknesses in people are arteria coronaries disease (blood stream impediment),
                trailed by cerebrovascular sickness and lower respiratory contaminations. Coronary diseases are most eccentric and
                unexpectable. We can become ready to foresee the coronary illness utilizing AI strategy. The datasets are taken from
                UCI store which is a public dataset. These prepared datasets are utilized for the expectation. Procedures like Decision
                tree, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest algorithms are utilized in the expectation of
                coronary illness and cross breed of these algorithms gives 94 % precision.

            <h1>Identification and Analysis of Digital Image Forgery.</h1>
            <p>
                Digital images are anything but difficult to control and alter because of accessibility of powerful image
                processing and editing software. The presentation of the proposed strategy is shown on several forged images .There are
                various types of criminal forgeries like images made through PC graphic tools (like 3D rendering) which appears as
                though genuine however are totally virtual and making a picture by changing its substance is another technique. The
                most straightforward path is to cut an item from one image and addition it into another image. By introducing the
                original and the forged digital images to different methodology like Pixel Subtraction, Block Matching, Region Masking,
                Light Variation and HSV level technique, forgery in an image can be detected. In all the techniques, an input forgery
                image is taken and processed at various levels utilizing level segmentation and filters. Then the processed imaged is
                compared with the original image to detect where exactly the forgery has taken place. Finally, the results obtained from
                both the techniques are analyzed and compared to determine their level of accuracy.

                Meaning of robot’s position comparative with the root organize is one of the main issues in dynamic field of
                savvy robots. In soccer robot, meaning of robot's accurate position is a central point of contention to get next choices.
                Among entire of the accessible sensors in robot, vision give most data with exceptionally high exactness in the greatest
                reach. self-confinement of robot is performed utilizing the taken picture by camera arranged at soccer humanoid robot's

                are shape and size changing of square shapes, circle and ground lines point change as per their distance of robot. The
                primary explanation behind these progressions is point between robot's camera and skyline line that cause to make
